# Electron tool lifecycle E2E

This Electron-hosted integration suite launches a real Electron process with Playwright. The test-only app imports the
production `ToolCallLifecycle` source after transpiling it into the ignored `.artifacts/`
directory, then supplies deterministic message, operation, retry, and local-execution adapters.
It uses the same Electron runtime version declared by `apps/desktop`. The test renderer clears its
pending indicator only when the lifecycle promise settles, and separately asserts that the
production operation snapshot has no `running` nodes.

This is a focused Electron-hosted lifecycle contract, not a packaged Masterino UI test: the
production Zustand adapters, approval action, message service, and TRPC router are covered by their
Vitest and database integration suites. A packaged desktop smoke test remains separate follow-up
work.

It intentionally does not use the Chromium/Next.js harness under `e2e/src`: that harness cannot
exercise Electron preload or IPC.

## Prerequisites

Install the workspace dependencies and ensure Electron's downloaded runtime is present:

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm --dir apps/desktop install
```

No Playwright browser download, database, Next.js server, or external network service is needed.

## Run

From the repository root:

```bash
pnpm exec playwright test --config=e2e/electron/playwright.config.mjs
```

To use a separately installed Electron executable:

```bash
ELECTRON_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/absolute/path/to/electron \
  pnpm exec playwright test --config=e2e/electron/playwright.config.mjs
```
